 * Playwright config for the TechPulse AI behavior-test suite.
 *
 * Tests run against the already-running dev stack:
 *   - frontend at http://localhost:3000
 *   - backend at http://127.0.0.1:8000
 *   - Ollama at http://localhost:11434 (only used by `*.live.spec.ts`)
 *
 * Default `npx playwright test` runs the deterministic suite.
 *
 * To make the recorded videos *watchable by a human*, every user action
 * is throttled by SLOW_MO (default 600ms). Override per-run:
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_SLOW_MO=0    — fast CI mode
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_SLOW_MO=1200 — slow demo mode
 *
 * Live integration spec (Ollama-dependent):
 *   npx playwright test research.live.spec.ts --grep @live
