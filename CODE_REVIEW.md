```
✅ 9 essential files in backend/
✅ No duplicate documentation
✅ All scripts in scripts/ folder
✅ Clean root directory
✅ Professional organization
```

#### **Scripts Folder** (`scripts/`)
```
✅ Organized & Accessible

Contents:
- setup-dev.bat/sh - Development setup
- start-app.bat/sh - Full stack startup
- start_frontend.bat - Frontend only
- start_production.bat - Backend only
