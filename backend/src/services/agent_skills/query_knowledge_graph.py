"""
query_knowledge_graph agent skill
=================================

Walks the co-mention graph built by :class:`EntityExtractionService`. Two
entities have a co-mention edge if they appeared in the same article;
edge weight = number of articles that mention BOTH.

Schema reminder (created by ``EntityExtractionService._ensure_tables_exist``):

* ``entities(id, name, type, mention_count, created_at)``
* ``entity_mentions(id, article_id, entity_id, position)``

The walk:

1. Match the seed entity by case-insensitive name (or fall through to
   a substring match if no exact hit).
2. BFS up to ``depth`` hops over the co-mention edges. ``depth=1`` (the
   default) returns the seed plus its direct neighbours.
3. Cap at ``max_nodes=20`` and ``max_edges=50`` to bound the payload —
   highly-connected entities (e.g. "OpenAI") would otherwise return
   hundreds of nodes and overwhelm the orchestrator's context.

Output is a stable list-of-dicts shape suitable for a frontend graph
viz, but the immediate consumer is the LLM orchestrator: it reads node
names + edge weights and decides what to ``summarize_article`` next.
