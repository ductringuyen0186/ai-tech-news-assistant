"""
extract_entities agent skill
============================

Wraps :meth:`EntityExtractionService.process_article`. The orchestrator
calls this when it needs the named entities mentioned in a specific
article — typically as input to ``query_knowledge_graph``, but also when
the user explicitly asks "who/what is in this story?".

The underlying service is idempotent (re-running on the same article
deletes prior mentions then re-inserts), so a tool retry never inflates
``entities.mention_count``.

Returns the entities the caller can consume directly, plus a count.
``process_article`` itself only returns an int (count persisted) so we
do a follow-up read of the entity rows for this article to assemble the
full payload.
