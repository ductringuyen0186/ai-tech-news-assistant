"""
Entity Extraction Service
=========================

Pulls named entities (companies, people, products, technologies) out of
article text using a local Ollama model and persists them to two tables:

* ``entities`` — one row per unique entity name, with a ``mention_count``
  rolled up across all articles.
* ``entity_mentions`` — one row per ``(article_id, entity_id)``, used to
  compute co-mention edges in the Knowledge Graph.

The service intentionally mirrors the project's existing raw-sqlite3 style
(see ``ArticleRepository`` and ``SettingsRepository``) rather than going
through SQLAlchemy sessions: the running backend never calls
``Base.metadata.create_all()`` and bootstraps tables lazily via
``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``. The SQLAlchemy ``Entity`` and
``EntityMention`` models in :mod:`src.database.models` describe the same
shape for typing / future Alembic migrations.

Sanity rules
------------
1B-class models hallucinate aggressively. Every candidate entity must
survive these checks before being persisted:

* length >= 3 chars
* not in a small English stopword set
* not a single common-news token (``news``, ``tech``, ``new``, ...)
* not all-caps unless it's on a small acronym whitelist
* type is one of ``company | person | product | technology | other``

Failures are logged and dropped; the article is still marked done.
