"""
Saved Research Repository
=========================

Data-access layer for the ``saved_research`` table (M3.M5). Mirrors the
lightweight ``sqlite3``-direct style used by
:class:`~src.repositories.settings_repository.SettingsRepository` and
:class:`~src.repositories.article_repository.ArticleRepository` — the
table is auto-created on first touch via ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``
so it works against both a fresh and an existing ``news.db``.

The ``sources_json`` column stores the sources list as JSON text. We
convert at the repository boundary so callers (routes, tests) always
deal in native Python lists of dicts.
