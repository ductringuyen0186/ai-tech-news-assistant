Knowledge Graph Route
=====================

Serves the data behind the frontend's Knowledge Graph tab. Returns the top-N
named entities (by mention count) and the co-mention edges between them.

The shape is intentionally NOT wrapped in BaseResponse — the frontend reads
``response.nodes`` and ``response.edges`` directly. Keep it that way.
