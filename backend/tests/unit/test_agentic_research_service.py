"""
Unit tests for AgenticResearchService (Milestone 1)
====================================================

Covers the four paths the M1 acceptance contract calls out:

1. ``test_run_happy_path`` - decomposer succeeds first try, every
   sub-question returns hits, synthesis emits a markdown report with
   inline ``[N]`` citations and a ``## Sources Used`` section. Verifies
   the event order is exactly:
       phase: "Decomposing"
       phase: "Searching (i/N)"  (one per sub-question)
       phase: "Synthesizing"
       phase: "done"

2. ``test_invalid_json_then_retry`` - first decomposer call returns
   garbage, second call (the strict retry) returns valid JSON. The run
   completes with the retried sub-questions; only one retry happened.

3. ``test_invalid_json_fallthrough`` - both decomposer calls return
   garbage; the run falls through to single-question mode and still
   completes with exactly one ``Searching (1/1)`` phase.

4. ``test_zero_hit_subquestion`` - one sub-question returns no hits;
   the run still completes, the synthesis prompt explicitly contains
   the "Could not find data on ..." instruction for that sub-question,
   and the final report has ``[N]`` + ``## Sources Used`` (because we
   stitch them server-side as a guard rail).

Ollama is mocked at the ``_call_ollama`` boundary so these tests run
without a live LLM. The SearchService is also faked.
