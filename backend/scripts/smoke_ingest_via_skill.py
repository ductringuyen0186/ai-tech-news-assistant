"""
M2.M6 Smoke test — ingestion via the shared summarize_article skill.
====================================================================

Goal
----
Confirm the orchestrator's new feature-flag path produces real summaries
when ``USE_AGENT_SKILL_SUMMARIZATION=True``, end-to-end against the live
Ollama backend the dev stack already has running.

Workflow
--------
1.  Pick 3 already-summarized articles from ``news.db``, backing up
    their existing summary text.
2.  NULL out their summary AND flip ``summary_generated = FALSE`` so the
    orchestrator picks them up on the next ``run_pending`` call.
3.  Run ``SummarizationOrchestrator.run_pending(limit=3)``.
4.  Confirm each article has a non-NULL ``summary`` again — and PRINT
    the title + first 200 chars of the new summary so a human can
    eyeball quality (the migration must produce summaries of comparable
    quality to the legacy path).
5.  Restore the original summary text on exit (so the corpus isn't
    perturbed by the smoke).

Run from ``backend/`` ::

    python scripts/smoke_ingest_via_skill.py

Caps wall-clock at 90s; exits with non-zero on failure.
